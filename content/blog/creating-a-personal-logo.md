# Poster revision

Part 1 of this week's assignment was to make revisions to our poster from last week based on class feedback. I made the changes the had been recommended to me by many people. I centered the _winter show 2020_ text vertically inside the white box, and I changed the date and venue text to stay within the bounds of their box. I also stopped the boxes from moving around as I found this to be a little annoying. In the interest of strengthing the layered feel of the poster, I added a little transparency to the boxes and the _ITP IMA_ text.

# Logo

## Inspiration

My initials are d.a.c. which in audio programming stands for digital to analog converter. I thought it would be fun to try to use this for my logo. Here are some ways _dac_ comes up in some of the technology I use regularly.

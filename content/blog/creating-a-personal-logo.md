# <span style="color: #32ffdb; background: #000">Poster Revision</span>

Part 1 of this week's assignment was to make revisions to our poster from last week based on class feedback. I made the changes the had been recommended to me by many people. I centered the _winter show 2020_ text vertically inside the white box, and I changed the date and venue text to stay within the bounds of their box. I also stopped the boxes from moving around as I found this to be a little annoying. In the interest of strengthing the layered feel of the poster, I added a little transparency to the boxes and the _ITP IMA_ text.

My initials are d.a.c. which in audio programming stands for digital to analog converter. I thought it would be fun to try to use this for my logo. Here are some ways _dac_ comes up in some of the technology I use regularly.

I tried to be proactive while creating this logo by regularly exporting images whenever I reacted a new checkpoint. My unfamiliarity with illustrator came through however. After some hours of work I checked the images and realized I had been exporting them at very low resolution and they looked terrible. I tried my best to re-create them in illustrator using the trace tool but sadly it wasn't great. I included them anyway so that I can show at least a sense of the pathway I took through this assignment.

In this first example I was trying to find a way to use the tilda character from the max example I showed earlier. I think it could have worked but I decided it's too closely related to max in general. Also these colours are not great.

I thought instead I should try to include my name that would function as an underline (and a sort of explanation of _dac_).

![3](../assets/visual-language/week-5/3.svg "attempt 3")
Here I try some other colours.

I liked this design but didn't feel like it really suited me personally.

This one was awful.

![6](../assets/visual-language/week-5/6.svg "attempt 6")

I accidentally discovered how to push letters around in illustrator so gave that a shot.

![9](../assets/visual-language/week-5/9.svg "attempt 9")

Decided for the second time around to try the _name as an underline_ thing. Added the _@_ because this is the tag I generally use in social media, instagram, github etc.

![10](../assets/visual-language/week-5/10.svg "attempt 10")

Added some colours. Didn't really like the blue.

## <span style="color: #ff22fc; background: #000">Final Logo & Style Guide</span>

I liked the pink so I used the colour tools in illustrator to choose an algorithmically linked colour and ended on <span style="color: #32ffdb; background: #000">Bright Turquoise</span>

# Poster revision

I made the changes the had been recommended to me by many people. I centered the _winter show 2020_ text vertically inside the white box, and I changed the date and venue text to stay within the bounds of their box. I also stopped the boxes from moving around as I found this to be a little annoying. In the interest of strengthing the layered feel of the poster, I added a little transparency to the boxes and the _ITP IMA_ text.

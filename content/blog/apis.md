Pokemon API

### A pokemon adaptation of a very basic live coding language

I repurposed what I did for last week to instead find images from the pokemon api!

Type the name of a pokemon followed by two numbers

e.g. `pikachu 4 7`

<Regex02 />

Nice!

Here is another project which I am working on at the moment that uses the sunrise API to sort through a list of youtube live streams and display the one that is closest to sunrise at the local time.

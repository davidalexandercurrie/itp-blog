# Project Description 

My idea for this project is to create an online browser-based gallery that evokes the aesthetics, feelings, and atmospheres of a liminal space. The space will be used to house my weird, forgotten, and unfinished projects. I want the web site to feel abandoned as though one is encountering a space with the lights *turned off*. To achieve this effect, I plan to incorporate playful takes on lighting, sound and space.

Lost, Forgotten, Machinery...

I am particularly interested in the sounds of an abandoned/ liminal website. When I watched this documentary I found the coupling of the sounds with the places very haunting.

This online audio installation I made in 2020 now feels abandoned and *liminal* to me, perhaps due to the movement and sounds, like ancient machinery that has been left running...

# Plan of Action

My plan is to port the prototype to three.js and add positional audio and reverb to simulate physical space. I want to include a section that has snippets of code from my live-coding practice as well as related audio that feel *forgotten* to me. I want to spatialise the different works, images, and soundclips both in 3D virtual space and 3D audio space. Many of the works that will be *on display* don't work anymore or were never finished, which personally makes them feel liminal.

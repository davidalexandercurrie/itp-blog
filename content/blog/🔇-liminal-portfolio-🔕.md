# Project Description 

My idea for this project is to create an online browser-based gallery of sorts the produces the feeling & atmosphere of a liminal space. The space will be used to house my weird, forgotten, unfinished projects. I want the web site to feel abandoned as though you are encountering a space with the lights *turned off*. To achieve this I plan to encorporate a playful take on lighting, sound & space.

Lost, forgotten, machinery.

I want to also play with the sound of an abandoned/liminal website. When I watched this documentary I found the coupling of the sounds with the places very haunting.

This online audio installation I made in 2020 now feels abandoned and *liminal* to me. I think this is because of the movement & sounds. It seems like ancient machinery that has just been left running.

# Plan of action

My plan is to port the rough idea of the prototype to three.js and encoroporate positional audio & reverb to add to the feeling of space. I want to include a section that has snippets of code from my live-coding practice and their associated audio that feel *forgotten* to me. I want to spatialise the different works/images/soundclips both in 3d virtual space as well as 3d audio space. Many of the works that will be *on display* don't work properly anymore or were just never finished which makes them independently feel liminal.

This week we were asked to read Understanding Comics - The Invisible Art by Scott McCloud. The book is itself a comic that examines the world of comics. 

The book addresses many areas of comics most of which I had not considered before. I found myself learning concepts not just about comics but also the film & visual art worlds and more generally I engaged in thought about storytelling practices.

The book goes into a lot of detail in many areas:

### Definition:

### History

* Western vs Eastern

### Symbols

### Realism vs cartoony

### Closure

* Imagination in between the frames

### Time & Motion

### Emotions

* Shapes
* Backgrounds
* Lettering

Final Thoughts:

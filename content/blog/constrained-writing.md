import Textbox from '../../src/components/textbox.js'

### Instructions

Type in the text box and submit some text.

The words will be swapped with similar words using the [Datamuse API](https://www.datamuse.com/api/)

<Textbox />

*This was also a way for me to experiment with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). A markdown format that allows for integration of react components.*
